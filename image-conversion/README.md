# Overview
# Configuration
- `migration.cfg` contains required configuration for image conversion.
- 
# Usage
- `bash migration_prep.sh` for classic source Linux instance.
- `ps migration_prep.ps1` for classic source Windows instance.
- Manual steps in between
    - Network reset
        - Windowsâ€“Network Settings -> Network & Internet -> Status -> Reset Network
        - This disables network access to machine
    - System prep
        - Execute following command
            - `C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\Sysprep.exe /oobe/generalize /shutdown "/unattend:C:\ProgramFiles\CloudbaseSolutions\Cloudbase-Init\conf\Unattend.xml"`
            - This will remove all system/hardware dependent files to make it work in any environment (cloud), This will also remove Administrator user files.
- Configure `migration.cfg`
- `bash migration.sh`
# Tips
- Execute pre check scripts ( hyperlink script files here )  as Admin user ( for windows ) or root user ( for linux ), to behave perfectly.
- Region mentioned in migration configuration file should match with region selected in IBM Cloud CLI.
- For windows, once QEMU tool is installed, append its installation path to windows environment variable.
- `migration.sh`, a migration script currently supports macOS and Linux only.
